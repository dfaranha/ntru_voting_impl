/**
 * The amortized exact proof of src/ntru_pismall.cpp, specialised to the statement
 * the proof of shuffle needs: the message committed in each of the n BDLOP
 * commitments P[i] is a ring constant. With g(i) = i, that is the algebraic
 * half of the membership required by Lemma 5 of ePrint 2025/658.
 *
 * The relation proven is the commitment equation itself, so the witness bound
 * is an opening of P[i] and no link between two commitment schemes is needed.
 * Unlike every other coefficient set in that file, this one is exact over Z_q:
 * the identity is f = 0 at each coefficient above the constant one, and f = 0
 * has a single root whether or not q is composite. The size half, which is
 * what makes the committed constants pairwise different by a unit, comes from
 * the norm bound of pibnd.h.
